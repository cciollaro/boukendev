冒険 ("bouken") is Japanese for "adventure". It's my dream to build apps for a living, and bouken.dev represents my adventure to try and make that happen.

I like building apps that I want to use myself and find useful.

Always feel free to reach out with ideas and feedback, I appreciate all of my users.
